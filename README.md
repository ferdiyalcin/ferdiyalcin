## Who Am I?

</div>

Hi, I'm Ferdi. After gaining experience in the stock market by trading for years, I stepped into the cryptocurrency world. I have been actively involved in this sector for about **three years**. At first, I traded using my traditional market experience. Later, I met launchpads and made significant gains. However, I discovered my true passion when I started working with testnets.<br>

Focusing on testnets for the **last year**, I have found my passion in this field. Supporting the developers of the industry, providing feedback during the building process of projects and contributing to the production of an ecosystem is an invaluable experience for me.<br>

Although I studied **C#** in high school, I focused on languages like **JavaScript** and **Python** and I'm currently trying to learn **Solidity**.

## About Nodes

</div>
Regarding nodes, although I participated in the testnet programs of the projects, I was not able to install nodes for a while due to lack of resources. However, in the meantime, I did my best to help the community. <br>

Now, I have successfully installed the nodes of several projects that gave me the opportunity. I prefer **Hetzner** as a server provider.

## Last Words

Finally, while it is possible to make financial gains in this sector, the excitement and contribution of being part of the innovations being introduced cannot be ignored. <br>
It is important to look at a project not just as a coin, but in terms of the potential and **innovations** it offers. With this vision, it is a great privilege for me to take part in the cryptocurrency world and be a part of this exciting journey.
